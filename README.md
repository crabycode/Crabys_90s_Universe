Devlog #1 pre-hack <br>
All participants were aware that the hackathon will be themed after the 1990s. I was born in 2004, therefore I didn't get to experience the 90s feel, but I performed extensive research and compiled a list of everything that makes a website 90s retro fashioned. <br>

Devlog #2 13.12.2024
The hackathon began, and I had no idea which track to choose, but I eventually overcame this challenge and chose track 1 (Dot com boom), which required me to reconstruct a website from the present in 90s style. So, as a Pokémon enthusiast, I thought it would be cool to create their website in the 1990s. So I started with the background and fought for an hour to create something I didn't use.
I decided to take a gym break, and while working out, I couldn't come up with any new ideas, so I switched to the second track, Now It's Personal. And when you're doing something personal, you're more motivated and have a lot of ideas, which is how my website came about. <br>
Devlog #3 13.12.2024 (post-gym :D)
I began working on my main page with Sublime Text Studio. I decided not to abandon the entire Pokemon concept, so the first thing I did was create a cool-looking website h1, with a Jolteon corssing it. I looked at stackoverflow to accomplish this.
After that, I glanced at my list and realized it was time for me to create the moving title in the tab, so I continued surfing stackoverflow and discovered a guide for that as well. Afterwards, I went to chatgpt and asked it to make a pixelated logo for my website's favicon, and I can say that with a few minor things adjusted with Photopea, I obtained a fairly good logo and found an intriguing 90s sonic cursor.
Then I checked over my list again and saw a YouTube instructional that covered everything about marquees. Another interesting element that I had to deal with was the sounds that I applied to the navbar. Strangely, I found it hard for them to function without any activity on the website. I had the same issue with the background music, so I created a music button to stop/play it. I ended day 1 by creating the navigation for the website and writing the about-me.<br>
Devlog #4 14.12.2024 (morning)
Last night before I went to bed, I came upon a channel that had tutorials on creating video games using JavaScript, and two of them drew my attention. At this point, I realized I needed to make subprojects, so I chose two:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej8SatOj3V4&t=566s
Making a contemporary index page with a door leading to the 90s world (my primary website) was another idea that crossed my mind. I blasted Daft Punk on my headphones and started working, even though I hadn't done much. To make it appear like a 90s version, I included a ton of gifs and insane CSS with animations. I also improved the navbar.
I then created the projects tab, which included my three web development projects. (I’m kiiinda happy (not satisfied this much) with how this one came out)
After this was done, I was left with only 1 tab from the navbar to create – the contact me form, and inspired from other 90s contact me forms I created a very simple one
Since most websites from the 1990s had viewscounters, I too had to make one. This is another issue that stackoverflow helped me with. I walked to the kitchen, had a great lunch, and started working after realizing that I needed to complete a guestbook website, a Pokemon TCG opening site, and a whack-a-mole game. I started by making modifiying the tutorial a bit by adding packs to my page that, when clicked, take users to another page with the unboxed reward. I am very pleased with the result.
I created a holo cards (rare cards) counter and urged the user to track how many holos he received on his pack since I thought it should somehow encourage user interaction! 
After finishing that, I desperately needed a break, so I went out for an hour to chill with my lovely girlfriend.<br>
Devlog #5 14.12.2024 (afternoon-evening)
In order to get back to work, I created the guestbook and all of its features.  
I included a section at the bottom of the page where all of the messages are kept.
After that, I enhanced my about-me tab and added even more gifs, because as I noted, GIFS EVERYWHERE!
After that, my family and I had a dinner break and decorated the Christmas tree. After that, I made the door to the 1990s page. Later, I felt it would be much nicer if it were a portal rather than a door. I spent the least amount of time on this page, and I was really pleased with how everything turned out. 
After finishing all the work and being left with just the whack-a-mole game, I decided to go and see my gf once again and spent the evening with her.<br>
Devlog #6 15.12.2024 (2:10AM)
I'm writing this after spending an entire evening that allowed me to refuel. One of the buttons at the bottom of the page now has a small Easter egg that I inserted while updating the devlogs.I have the idea of creating a tamagochi-like creature in my website which users can pet, but we will see how much time will I have tomorrow, because I’m not a professional JavaScript coder and I have to make an online game following a tutorial. <br>
Devlog #7 15.12.2024(morning)
I got up and started the creation of the whack-a-mole game. I had some difficulties, I had in mind to remove this feature, because I struggled a lot even when following the tutorial, because I wanted to add a little something from myself. After some hours of harwdork, I managed to finish it and finished my website.<br>
Devlog#8 15.12.2024(afternoon)
Two hours before the project time ended, I uploaded mine and now I can give my eyes a well deserved rest. It was a great hackathon! I learned a lot of new things, more css rules, css animations, some javascript and more. Thank you for reading my devlogs! I hope you like the website and sign my guestbook :3!
